- **Statement**: Security flaws with software applications are discovered daily. Vendors are constantly updating and patching their products to address newly discovered security vulnerabilities. Organizations (including any contractor to the organization) are required to promptly install security-relevant software updates (e.g., patches, service packs, and hot fixes). Flaws discovered during security assessments, continuous monitoring, incident response activities, or information system error handling must also be addressed expeditiously. 

Organization-defined time periods for updating security-relevant software may vary based on a variety of factors including, for example, the security category of the information system or the criticality of the update (i.e., severity of the vulnerability related to the discovered flaw). 

This requirement will apply to software patch management solutions that are used to install patches across the enclave and also to applications themselves that are not part of that patch management solution. For example, many browsers today provide the capability to install their own patch software. Patch criticality, as well as system criticality will vary. Therefore, the tactical situations regarding the patch management process will also vary. This means that the time period used must be a configurable parameter. Time frames for application of security-relevant software updates may be dependent upon the Information Assurance Vulnerability Management (IAVM) process.

CylanceON-PREM will be configured to check for and install security-relevant software updates within an identified time period from the availability of the update. The specific time period will be defined by an authoritative source (e.g., IAVM, CTOs, DTMs, and STIGs).
- **Check**: Verify the system is the latest release. Administrator access is required.

Verify the version: 
1. Navigate to CONFIGURATION >> Settings.
2. Verify the version.

If the system is not at the latest released version, this is a finding.
- **Fix**: Administrator access is required to upgrade the system.

1. Log in to the Cylance support portal (myAccount.blackberry.com) and download the latest On-Prem update package.
2. Enable Maintenance Mode.
3. Take VM Snapshots for back up purposes.
4. Navigate to CONFIGURATION >> Settings.
5. Under "CylanceON-PREM Info", select "Upgrade".
6. Choose the latest CylanceON-PREM file and click "Start Upgrade".

Monitor for the "Update is in progress" message and a "Successful update" notification upon completion. The appliance will then restart automatically.

### V-272641
- **Control ID**: CYLN-OP-001105
- **Name**: CylanceON-PREM must be restarted every 30 days to invoke health checks.
- **Vuln ID**: V-272641
- **Rule ID**: SV-272641r1112773_rule
- **SRG**: SRG-APP-000473
- **STIG Severity**: CAT II (MEDIUM)
- **Mapped Severity**: HIGH
- **CIA**: A
- **CCIs**: CCI-002699, CCI-002710
- **Also Satisfies**: SRG-APP-000473, SRG-APP-000475
- **Statement**: Restarting CylanceON-PREM every 30 days ensures system stability and performance.

Regular health checks of the system reduce the risk of security function failures in the system.
- **Check**: Verify the reboot date. Administrator privileges are required.

1. Click AUDIT LOGS.
2. Search for "Reboot" and note the date.

If date is more than 30 days in the past, this is a finding.
- **Fix**: Reboot the server. Administrator privileges are required. 

1. Perform a backup.
2. Navigate to CONFIGURATION >> Settings.
3. Enable Maintenance Mode.
4. Click on "Reboot".

### V-272642
- **Control ID**: CYLN-OP-001270
- **Name**: All associated custom applications, including API endpoints, must be inventoried and managed.
- **Vuln ID**: V-272642
- **Rule ID**: SV-272642r1113686_rule
- **SRG**: SRG-APP-000516
- **STIG Severity**: CAT II (MEDIUM)
- **Mapped Severity**: HIGH
- **CIA**: C, A
- **CCIs**: CCI-000366
- **Statement**: The Console Applications page provides integration with the CylanceON-PREM API. An application has a unique application ID and application secret for generating an access token, which is used to access the API. Administrators create the applications, then give API users the application ID and application secret.

Inventorying and managing CylanceON-PREM's associated custom applications and API endpoints is critical for securing the environment, ensuring compliance, minimizing risks, maintaining operational efficiency, and improving incident response. 

By knowing what applications and APIs exist and how they function, organizations can enhance the ability to protect, monitor, and manage systems effectively, thus safeguarding sensitive data and improving overall security posture.
- **Check**: Review the Console Applications. Administrator privileges are required.

1. Log in to the admin console.
2. Navigate to Configuration >> Applications.
3. Review the documentation of allowed applications.
4. Review the internal documentation for the location and protection of application ID and application secret.
5. All APIs must be documented.
6. Verify that controls are in place for who has access to APIs and where YAML files are stored. 

If any applications exist that are not documented, this is a finding.

If application ID and application secrets are not documented and stored in the authorized location, this is a finding.

If any APIs are in use and not documented, this is a finding.

If the location and access of YAML files are not documented, this is a finding. 

If any of the above is documented but not adhered to, this is a finding.
- **Fix**: Manage Custom Applications. Administrator privileges are required.

1. Log in to the admin console.
2. Navigate to Configuration >> Applications.
2a. To edit an application: 
     - Click the "Edit" icon.
     - Update the application name or permissions.
     - Click the green check to save.
2b. To remove an application: 
     - Click the trash can icon.
     - Click "Remove Application".
2c. To view the YAML file, click the API Documentation link.
